		<h2>"Javascript is off."</h2>
		SNIK Graph does not work without JavaScript. Please ensure that JavaScript <a href="http://enable-javascript.com/">is enabled</a>.

		<h2>Some features are not working or are not displayed correctly</h2>
		SNIK Graph uses some features of ECMAScript 6, so please ensure that your browser is up to date. For example at least Firefox 48, Microsoft Edge 14 or
		Chrome 52 should work. Internet Explorer is discontinued and thus not supported. If you still encounter errors,
		<a href="#bugreport">please submit a bug report</a>.

		<h2>Mobile</h2>
		SNIK Graph is not optimized for Smartphones and Tablets, as such both the controls and performance may be unsatisfactory. Feel free to
		<a href="contribute.html">contribute</a> if you want to improve that.

		<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
		SNIK Graph is a research prototype developed part-time by a single researcher who is not a JavaScript expert and as such does not undergo the extensive
		testing and development of big projects. As such, <a href="contribute.html">contributions</a> and suggestions are always appreciated, However, HTML 5 and
		ECMAScript 6 are used by choice and we will not approve changes that compromise the clarity or size of the source code by adding compatibility layers for
		outdated browser versions.
