		<h1>Contribute to SNIK Graph</h1>
		<img src="img/graph.png" class="helpimage" />
		SNIK Graph is <a href="https://github.com/snikproject/snik-graph">hosted on GitHub</a> and is based on the graph library
		<a href="http://js.cytoscape.org">Cytoscape.js</a>. Feel free to fork and create a pull request or, if you plan or frequent contributions, ask us to include
		you in the GitHub team.

		<h2>Contribution Ideas</h2>
		If you want to contribute but are not sure in which way, here are some suggestions:
		<ul>
			<li>display RDF directly instead of needing JSON files</li>
			<li>support other languages</li>
			<li>improve mobile controls and performance</li>
			<li>rank and detect typos in search</li>
			<li>use more intuitive and pleasing color schemes</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Coding Conventions</h2>
		UTF-8 encoding, Linux (\n) linebreaks, single tab indentation. Prettier automatically formats the code with the Husky commit hook. Single-feature commits
		with useful messages.
