		<h1>SNIK Graph Manual</h1>
		<center><img src="paper/img/graph.png" class="helpimage" /></center>
		<h1>Multiview Functionality</h1>
		SNIK Graph supports the organization and management of different partial models in separate views.To copy a part of the whole graph, press 'C' or 'S' and to
		insert it into a new model press 'V' or 'P'.
		<h2>Search Field</h2>
		Search the currently active view for resources by entering a full or partial name.
		<h2>View Specific Menu</h2>
		The view-specific menu can be found in the upper right position of each view, described from left to right.
		<center><img src="img/viewmenu.png" class="helpimage" /></center>
		<h3>Recalculatesign</h3>
		Recalculate Layout
		<h3>Tightlayoutsign</h3>

		<h3>Compoundlayoutsign</h3>
		Compound layout
		<h3>Addsign</h3>
		Open new Tab
		<h3>Plussign</h3>
		Zoom in
		<h3>Minussign</h3>

		<h1>Menu</h1>
		<h2>File</h2>
		Holds different file options like loading and saving the graph in different ways.
		<h3>Load From SPARQL Endpoint</h3>
		Discard the currently loaded graph and load all ontologies of SNIK.
		<h3>Load Session</h3>
		Load a complete session from a Cytoscape JSON File. Caution: Discards all changes!
		<h3>Load Partial Graph</h3>
		Load a saved view (partial graph) and include it in the current session.
		<h3>Save Session</h3>
		Save the complete Session (all views).
		<h3>Save Complete SNIK Graph As Cytoscape File</h3>
		Save the complete SNIK graph to a Cytoscape file.
		<h3>Save Current Partial Graph</h3>
		Save only the currently active view (partial graph).
		<h3>Recalculate Layout And Replace In Browser Cache</h3>
		Recalculate the position of all visible nodes. May take a while when a large number of nodes are visible.
		<h3>Save Image Of Current View</h3>
		Save a screenshot of the currently active view.
		<h3>Save Image Of Whole Graph</h3>
		Save an image of the whole graph with the same pixel density as the current view.
		<h3>Save Image Of Current View (high Res)</h3>
		Save an image of the current view with a high resolution, for example for printing.
		<h3>Save Image Of Whole Graph (high Res)</h3>
		Save an image of the whole graph with a high resolution, for example for printing.
		<h2>Filter</h2>
		A collection of filters to display relevant subgraphs. Filters are applied to all open views.
		<h3>Meta</h3>
		The Meta Ontology provides common superclasses and properties for the subontologies of SNIK.
		<h3>Bb</h3>
		Based on the book "Health Information Systems Ontologyâ€“Architectures and Strategies".
		<h3>Ob</h3>
		Based on the book"IT-Projektmanagement im Gesundheitswesen - Lehrbuch und Projektleitfaden.
		<h3>He</h3>
		Based on the book "Informationsmanagement: Grundlagen, Aufgaben, Methoden".
		<h3>Ciox</h3>
		Based on interviews about the Health Information System with Department B1, the Department for Information Management, of the Uniklinikum Leipzig.
		<h3>Role</h3>
		Who...
		<h3>Function</h3>
		...does what...
		<h3>Entitytype</h3>
		...and which information is therefore needed.
		<h2>Options</h2>
		Here you can find different checkboxes that toggle the behaviour of SNIK Graph. These are applied to all open views.
		<h3>Separate Subs</h3>
		Spread the SNIK Graph into subgraphs of the subontologies.
		<h3>Cumulative Search</h3>
		Keep previous search results visible when searching again.
		<h3>Show Grid</h3>
		shows a grid that supports better organizing of nodes.
		<h3>Combine Match</h3>
		Highlights groups of classes representing the same concept from different subontologies (matches) by placing them in boxes. Use "move matches on top of each
		other" or "move matches nearby" to shrink those boxes.
		<h3>Show Instances</h3>
		Display instances of SNIK Classes, if loaded via parameter.
		<h3>Day Mode</h3>
		White background. Saves ink when printing.
		<h3>Dev Mode</h3>
		Additional context menu entries for developers.
		<h3>Ext Mode</h3>
		Additional context menu entries for power users.
		<h2>Layout</h2>
		This part of the menu holds the layout features.
		<h3>Show Close Matches</h3>
		Shows (unhides) all nodes that are connected via close matches to visible nodes.
		<h3>Recalculate Layout</h3>
		Hotkey: Ctrl+Alt+L. Recalculates the position of all selected nodes, or all visible nodes if there are not at least two selected nodes. Can take a while if
		there are many visible nodes.
		<h3>Tight Layout</h3>
		Hotkey: Ctrl+Alt+T. You can use this for a more narrow view.
		<h3>Compound Layout</h3>
		Hotkey: Ctrl+Alt+C. Layout that tries to places combined matches next to each other.
		<h3>Move Matches On Top Of Each Other</h3>
		Requires enabled "Combine Matching" option. Places all matching nodes in the center of their group.
		<h3>Move Matches Nearby</h3>
		Requires enabled "Combine Matching" option. Places all matching nodes in a small circle in their group.
		<h3>BB Chapter Search</h3>
		Presents you all chapters of the "blue book" and lets you build a subgraph out of selected chapters .
		<h3>OB Chapter Search</h3>
		Presents you all chapters of the "orange book" and lets you build a subgraph out of selected chapters .
		<h3>Subontology Connectivity</h3>
		Shows the connectivity between chosen Subontologies, i.e. between BB and OB, in a new tab.
		<center><img src="img/subontologyConnectivity.png" class="helpimage" /></center>
		<h3>Reset View</h3>
		Resets all the layout operations to get you back to the starting point of the visualization.
		<h3>Change Title Of Active View</h3>
		Opens a propmt to change the title of the currently active view.
		<h2>Services</h2>
		Other ways to access SNIK.
		<h3>SPARQL Endpoint</h3>
		Expert interface for the SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language endpoint.
		<h3>RDF Browser</h3>
		Browse complete descriptions of resources in the RDF browser.
		<h2>Language</h2>
		Language switch, you can choose between English, German and Persian. Ontologies may not or not fully support all available languages.
		<h2>Help</h2>
		Common Help Menu, holds e.g. this manual
		<h1>Context Menu</h1>
		Right click on a node/edge to open the context menu and choose among:
		<h2>Basic Menu Items</h2>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		Opens the node in an RDF browser, which shows all its properties and values.
		<h3>Star</h3>
		Highlights and expands the node and all its directly connected nodes.
		<center><img src="img/star.png" class="helpimage" /></center>
		<h3>Incoming Star</h3>
		Highlights and expands the node and all neighbours directly connected via incoming edges.
		<h3>Outgoing Star</h3>
		Highlights and expands the node and all neighbours directly connected via outgoing edges.
		<h3>Path</h3>
		Shortest Path between a selected source and this node.
		<center><img src="img/star.png" class="helpimage" /></center>
		<h3>Spiderworm</h3>
		The Spider Worm consists of the shortest path between a selected source and this node plus all direct neighbours. Displaying a spiderworm hides all other
		nodes and edges.
		<center><img src="paper/img/spiderworm.png" class="helpimage" /></center>
		<h3>Edit</h3>
		If you are a domain expert and notice incorrectly modelled facts or connections of a node, feel free to send us an issue.
		<h3>Combine Close Matches</h3>
		Merge equivalent classes from different subontologies.
		<h3>Class Use</h3>
		Visualize the interplay of role, function and entity type (related to the Meta model).
		<h3>Hide</h3>
		Hide the selected item until the view is resetted.
		<h3>Set Path-source</h3>
		Set the starting point for path operations.
		<h3>Confirm Link</h3>
		Confirm that the automatically generated interlink is correct.
		<h2>Dev Mode</h2>
		<h3>Remove Permanently</h3>
		Send us an issue to delete the selected item permanently. Also removes it until graph is reloaded.
		<h3>Ontowiki</h3>
		Access restricted ontology editing tool.
		<h3>Debug</h3>
		Get debug information to the edge/node from the JSON File
		<h2>Ext Mode</h2>
		<h3>Doublestar</h3>
		The double star is like the spiderworm but shows connected nodes for both source and target, not just the target.
		<center><img src="img/doublestar.png" class="helpimage" /></center>
		<h3>Starpath</h3>
		Creates a path and star (expand) every node along it.
		<center><img src="img/starpath.png" class="helpimage" /></center>
		<h3>Circlestar</h3>
		A star (expansion of the node) using a circular layout. Hides all other nodes.
		<center><img src="img/circlestar.png" class="helpimage" /></center>
		<h3>Lodlive</h3>
		Third party data visualization exploration tool.
